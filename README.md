# JavaScript TypeScript Game

This Project is a web based text adventure game built using Typescript, HTML and CSS. The project goal was 
to create a game that used relevant JS/TS methods to create a game that interacted with the DOM and ran 
smoothly with no bugs. This particular game takes a user input of clicking on the screen to pick the relvant
answers - each answer clicked displaying a different story.

   labeled variables and functions.
